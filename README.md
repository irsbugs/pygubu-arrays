# Pygubu-arrays

* Manually add a label array to a Pygubu Designer created tkinter application. 
* Create class-wide instance variables for tkinter widgets.

## Pygubu and Pygubu-Designer 

* [Pygubu](https://pypi.org/project/pygubu/) - A simple GUI builder that loads and builds user interfaces defined in XML, for the python tkinter module.

* [Pygubu-designer](https://pypi.org/project/pygubu-designer/) - A simple GUI designer for the python tkinter module, that helps you create the xml definition graphically.

## Issue

The Pygubu Designer will allow a container to have individual labels. It does not support creation of an array of labels within a container.

For example, you may wish to have a tkinter Labelframe container to have 16 labels to represent individual binary bits in a 16 bit register.
